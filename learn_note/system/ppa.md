ppa
===

> ppa is personal package archives. 

we can find a PPA source with google , we can search "softname + PPA" or we
can use "launchpad.net" to search, then use `sudo apt-add-repository` add 
this PPA to our sources.list 

then use `sudo apt-get update ` and `sudo apt-get install xxxx` 

if we want to update this software we just use `sudo apt-get upgrade` 

Note: when we search software in launchpad.net, we can see this page will 
give us the "ppa's name" like "ppa:user/ppa" so we just need to do some 
option above.
