date
===

if we want to get the date in own format.we can use format argument.

* date '+%Y-%m-%d' we can get the time like 2014-07-11
* date '+%D' this option we will get 07/12/14, month/day/year
* date -s  we can use this option to set the format of time by our mind.

all of this we can see "man page"
